<p>As explained on Mark Tribe’s website:</p>
<p>
StarryNight was both a <strong>mirror</strong> and a <strong>map</strong>...it offered a <strong>reflection</strong> of the Rhizome.org community's reading habits…[and] acted as a <strong>navigational interface</strong> by connecting similar stars/texts into constellations regardless of their brightness.

As <strong>interface art</strong>, StarryNight explored some of the possibilities offered by the Internet: <strong>global artistic collaboration, realtime collection</strong> and <strong>filtering of information</strong> using automated software, the <strong>integration of user-generated data</strong> such as Web site hits, and the <strong>dissolution of authorial control.</strong>
